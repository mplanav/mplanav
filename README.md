# 👋 Hi, I'm Marc Plana Villalbí

I'm an aspiring computer science engineer with a deep curiosity for technology and how it shapes the world. I'm not just focused on software development—I'm eager to learn from every area that sparks innovation.

I'm particularly interested in the environments, tools, and applications of **Artificial Intelligence**, as well as the **management and analysis of data**. I enjoy building things, understanding how systems work, and growing through continuous learning.

## 💡 What I'm into

- 💻 Software development (still learning and experimenting!)
- 🤖 AI and machine learning – how it works and how to use it creatively
- 📊 Data handling and analysis – from databases to insights
- 🌐 Web technologies – front-end and back-end basics
- 🧠 Learning new things, always

## 🛠️ Technologies I'm using or exploring

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, C++, Java
- **Web**: HTML, CSS, React (learning)
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VSCode, Trello, WordPress, Docker (learning), WebSockets (learning)
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB (beginner level), Django

## 📁 Some Projects

I’m currently working on small projects to sharpen my skills. More coming soon!

- [`PATHFINDING`](https://github.com/mplanav/PATHFIDING) – That's my best project so far, where I applicated the most technologies I know.
